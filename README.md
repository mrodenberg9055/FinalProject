# FinalProject - Data Analyst 
## Topic: 
Where is the best place for a up and coming data analyst to work? We selected this topic because we want to better inform ourselves and colleges on how location can effect job opportunites. Our data has mostly been sourced from job search websitle like Indeed.
## Outline:
### Questions to answer:
* What location has the highest income vs cost of living?
* What locations/companies have the highest approval rating?
* What place has the lowest covid risk?
### Communication
We have been communicating on Slack and making great use of class time for collaboration.
## Database
* We have csv files conatianing information on cost of living, covid data, crime rates, unemployment, and information on local schools.
* We have a view in page admin that joins a few of the datasets by city name. The output:
